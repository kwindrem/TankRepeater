# NOTE: TankRepeater should NOT be run on Venus OS v2.70~12 or any future version
# Venus now natively supports NMEA2000 tank systems that report multiple tanks
# Running TankRepeater could create side effects like duplicating a tank

# This module creates a dBus tank 'repeater' for handling NMEA2000 tank sensor systems that report more than one tank
# While written for the SeeLevel system, it may work for other CanBus sensors that report multiple tanks.
# The Venus NMEA2000 dBus services assume only one tank (aka sensor aka fluid type) per external device
# so all tanks end up in the same dBus service resulting in each tank overwriting the others
# To avoid this, individual dBus "repeater' services for each tank are created
# data for each tank is extracted from the NEMA2000 tank dBus service and published to a separate repeater service
# 
# This module handles all 6 defined tanks. 
# The SeeLevel N2K sensor system supports at most 3 tanks (1 = fresh, 2 = gray, 5 = black)
# Other N2K systems may report more and this repeater should be able to handle them as long as
# the tank number is unique

# The dBus tank service processed by TankRepeater is identified by its product ID stored in non-volatile settings at
# dbus com.victron.settings /Settings/Devices/TankRepeater/IncomingProdId
# When this process first starts, it creates the setting with a default value of 41312
# If the ProcessId for the service of interest is different dbus-spy can be used to change it
# Use dbus-spy to inspect the SeeLevel tank service for the proper value to enter
# Setting ProcessId to -1 disables the repeater. Venus may need to be restarted to purge any repeaters
# that have already been created

# dbus com.victron.settings /Settings/Devices/TankRepeater/TankRepeaterService is set by the repeater program
# so that the GUI can hide the appropirate service

# Limitation: Only one repeater program is permitted since a second one would attempt to create duplicate dBus services

# Modifications to OverviewMobile.qml in the GUI arr needed to hide the incoming Tank's dBus object that rotates between tank data
# Modificaitons to TileTank.qml have also been made to:
#  alert the operatortor of loss of communciaitons with tank system
#  display custom tank names
#  remove flashing and add error messages, replacing the tank fullness percentage
#  squeeze the tile height when necessary to fit more tanks into the available space

# The service daemon insures this repeater module runs at startup and restarts it should it crash 
# To run this module, a link to the TankRepeater directory is created in the /service directory

# The Repeater dBus services are created only after data is received from sender for the related tank
# to avoid GUI clutter

# A timeout mechanism control's the repeater's /Connected flag to indicate if the Repeater service is active or not
# when the sender stops reporting data for a specific tank, The repeater's /Connected flag will eventually be cleared by this timeout mechanism
# The GUI (TileTank) then tests /Connected to hide report "No Response" in the Tanks column

# SeeLevel sends /FluidType, /Level and /Capacity
# /FluidType is enumerated consistently with other Victron tanks
# /Level is in percentage (100 = full)
# /Level is used to report a sensor error, however the Venus NMEA2000 tank driver limits these values to 0-100%
# so there is no way to display a sensor error (such as an open in the wiring)
# SeeLevel reports capacity in liters * 10 and the tank driver converts this to cubic meters used elsewhere in the Venus code
# /Remaining is calculated in the Repeater

# SeeLevel reports information for all tanks about every 3-4 seconds
# However, it can get into a mode where info for all tanks is sent very quickly, then no activity for ~ 3 seconds
# Polling for changes can miss data for a specific tank which makes it appear that the tank is not being reported (timeout)
# For this reason, PropertiesChanged signal handlers for /FluidType, /Level and /Capacity are used to collect tank info
# But this also is tricky since a signal for a level or capacity change may not be issued for every tank.
# For example, if all tanks are empty, the level signal handler is never called! 
# The same would be true for /FluidLevel if there was only one tank.
# The signal handlers for /FluidType, /Level and /Capacity store the values received.
# On the next /FluidType signal, the combination of /FluidType, /Level and /Capacity previuosly stored are consistent.
# Those values are sent to the appropriate repeater which stores the values for later.
# The repeater's background task validates values, creates the dBus service if necessary then updates the dBus service witb new values.
# The background task also polls for the incoming tank dBus information to be used in the absence of signals.
# The signal handlers are called from another thread/process so the amount of time spent in these routines is kept to a minimum.
